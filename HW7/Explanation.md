First, sort the intervals from earliest to latest start times. Then, begin inserting the end times into a min heap. If the start time of the inserted interval is greater than the earliest end time, that means we can use an existing room, since there is a room that had a meeting, but the meeting is over. That means we pop the top of the heap to remove that ending time. However, if the earliest ending time is later than the start time of the interval we wish to insert, we just increment the number of rooms we need.
