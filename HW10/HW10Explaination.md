In this homework, the code starts by adding the root node into the queue. Then, it loops through removing all the nodes from the queue and adding them to a list in the final list of lists. It will also simulatneously add the children of each node in the queue into the queue, but these child nodes will not be added into the list until the next iteration. After a loop iteration where the queue is empty, the code returns the list of lists. If the initial root node was empty however, it returns null or None.
