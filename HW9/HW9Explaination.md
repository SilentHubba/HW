This method first recursively searches the tree for a node that does not have p and q on the same side of a current nodeâ€™s child node. If both p and q are in the left subtree of the current node, then the lowest common ancestor is somewhere in the left subtree. Therefore, the algorithm will recursively call itself on the left subtree. This is also the same as what happens on the right subtree, where if p and q are in the right subtree, then the method recursively calls itself on the right subtree. When p and q are no longer in the same subtree, then the method returns the current node itself as the lowest common ancestor, since it must be the lowest common ancestor.
