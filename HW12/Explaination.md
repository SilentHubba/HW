First, create each house as a node. Also, create a node that connects all houses, but the connections are the cost to build a well at each house. Then, create connections from house to house based on the connections defined in pipes. If there are two connections, keep the one with the lowest cost. Next, create a min heap to store the cost of edges. With this min heap, perform Prim's algorithm to get the MST for this graph. 
This MST is created by starting at a random node and adding its edges to the heap. Then, remove the minimum cost edge from the heap and see if it connects to a node that has not been discovered. If it does, add the cost to the final cost and add all of the new connections to the heap. Repeat this until all nodes have been visited, and return the final cost.
